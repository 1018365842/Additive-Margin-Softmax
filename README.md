# Additive-Margin-Softmax
This is the implementation of paper &lt;Additive Margin Softmax for Face Verification>

Training logic is didn't provide here, it is highly inspired by Sandberg's Facenet. Instead, ##model structure can be found at resface.py## and ##loss head can be found at AM-softmax.py##
